 <p>How can I serve the standards?</p>
 <p>As educators, you play a key role in legitimising and spreading an ideology. Teachers generally occupy a position of trust for students, which makes you well placed to add an aura of authenticity to the corrosive acid of digital citizenship. Keep scrolling for some key ways that you can convert your classroom into a training ground for digital serfs!</p>

<h1>&nbsp;Substitution</h1>
<p>The best way to inculcate the mindset of a digital serf into your students is through the technique of substitution.</p>

<td style="width: 607px;">Instead of drawing, use Canva! That way, students can select from pre-set collections of items created by others.</td>

<td style="width: 103.6px;">Writing things down</td>
<td style="width: 138.4px;">Looking things up</td>
<td style="width: 607px;">Writing is known to improve recall over typing. This is bad, because the act of remembering requires "cognitive load" which should be avoided. By outsourcing memory to the computer, students can receive algorithm-curated information at their leisure and finally complete the process of digital amnesia that humankind began with the invention of writing.</td>

<td style="width: 138.4px;">Communication mediated by a platform</td>
<td style="width: 607px;">Instead of using physical materials, which can lead to accidental eye contact, students should only see each other's cursors on their individual screens.</td>

<td style="width: 138.4px;">Living in an anxious state of 'digital amnesia' where identity and memory are on the cloud, with subscription fees</td>
