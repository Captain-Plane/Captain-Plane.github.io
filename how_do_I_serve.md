 <p>How can I serve the standards?</p>
 <p>As educators, you play a key role in legitimising and spreading an ideology. Teachers generally occupy a position of trust for students, which makes you well placed to add an aura of authenticity to the corrosive acid of digital citizenship. Keep scrolling for some key ways that you can convert your classroom into a training ground for digital serfs!</p>

<h1>&nbsp;1. Substitution</h1>
<p>The best way to inculcate the mindset of a digital serf into your students is through the technique of substitution.</p>

<td style="width: 607px;">Writing is known to improve recall over typing. This is bad, because the act of remembering requires "cognitive load" which should be avoided. By outsourcing memory to the computer, students can receive algorithm-curated information at their leisure and finally complete the process of digital amnesia that humankind began with the invention of writing.</td>

<h1>&nbsp;2. Embedding</h1>
<p>Digital Literacy can be embedded in the mathematics curriculum using the only valuable part of the standards: <strong>To select and operate tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="font-weight: normal;" align="left">Using Microsoft Excel to collect and plot data. This can be aligned to students&rsquo; interests, but there are many easily accessible data sources relating to sport, medicine, money, and politics. Excel has access to simple plotting functions which allow the students to interpret the data that they have collected. They can calculate &lsquo;lines of best fit&rsquo; using algebra techniques. One interesting activity would be to encourage students to find spurious correlations (such as between ice-cream sales and deaths by drowning) to facilitate reflections on misleading data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="font-weight: normal;" align="left">Mapping software, for example the free program QGIS, can be used to look at spatial data and perform simple calculations. A classic example is the Mercator projection, the most common way for the world to be displayed in Australia. The Mercator projection famously increases the apparent area of European and North American countries, as well as Australia, and shrinks the area of countries closer to the equator. These countries tend to be in Africa, southeast Asia, or Latin America. Students can estimate the size of countries from the map, then perform the calculation using the software and see how inaccurate it was. Since many of the students at my school are immigrants from Africa and the Middle East, they can see how &lsquo;common sense&rsquo; can be misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="font-weight: normal;" align="left">Students can calculate the average wage for different parts of Australia using census data. They can also compare the mean with the median, including how the media reports the median or the mean for wages depending on whether they want the figure to be higher (mean) or lower (median). This can be done using excel, or for advanced students using one of many free programming languages such as Python or R, so that they can experience professional tools in a context they can relate to, and in away which builds critical thought as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="font-weight: normal;" align="left">The most important part of digital literacy from a mathematical point of view is to empower students to collect their own data and perform simple calculations in order to fact check claims in the media. Data about current world issues can be taken from media articles on climate change, covid-19, and the wars in Gaza and Ukraine which can allow students to compare different sources, and seek out their own information to empower them to draw their own conclusions.</p>

</ul>
