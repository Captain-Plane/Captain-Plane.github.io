 <p>The Digital Literacy Standards have been helpfully grouped into four categories: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Impossible to Teach / Internally Contradictory</li>
  <li> Possible to Teach, but undesirable</li>
  <li> Valuable to students, but only because their lives will be easier if they embrace techno-feudalism</li>
  <li> Valuable to students</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h1>Impossible to teach</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage digital wellbeing</strong><strong>:</strong> Cannot be taught because it doesn't exist</li>
<li><strong>Manage online privacy:</strong> Cannot be taught, as online privacy is impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Possible to teach, but undesirable</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage digital identity: </strong>Fraudulant concept, digital identity is just your regular identity but monetisable</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate and exchange: </strong>Key element in the training of digital serfs.<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Locate information: </strong>Curation is the enemy of creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Collect and collate data: </strong>part of AI indoctrination, and data is available because someone has made it available as part of their propaganda efforts.<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Plan and Design: </strong>dehumanises the process of design. Project management is really boring and they can learn MS project later in life.</li>
<li><strong>Create Content: </strong>Second key component of serf-training</li>
<li><strong>Respect Intellectual Property: </strong>Pure propaganda</li>
<li><strong>Manage Content: </strong>i.e. start paying those cloud subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Valuable to students, but only because their lives will be easier if they embrace techno-feudalism</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicate: </strong>It's probably better to embrace deeply unsatisfying forms of communication than be even more alone<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Protect Content:</strong> The reference to firewalls and anti-malware applications is a little dated and reflects the pre-web 2.0 early 2000s internet optimism of ACARA's approach more broadly. But the year level goals are solid.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Valuable to students</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpret data: </strong>Visualising things is always fun</li>
<li><strong>Select and Operate Tools: </strong>If digital literacy was regular literacy, this one would be "learn to read and write". The rest of the standards are either superfluous or actively harmful.</li>
</ul>
