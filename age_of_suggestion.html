        <h1>What is the Age of Suggestion</h1>
        <p>The Age of Suggestion is the era that follows the Information Age. You can read about the information age anywhere, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Industrial_Revolution_(Information_Age)">including on wikipedia</a>. As always there is a clamour of people declaring that the age is over, and trying to name whatever era is to follow it. The era could end with some form of collapse, which could take any number of forms and, if it occurs, mark a clear transition period. Many eras of history end with collapses, but others end when people's lives become qualitatively different to what they were before. Barring a collapse, we are currently entering a new era, the suggestion age.</p>
        <p><a href="/index.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Return Home</a></p>
      </div>

          <h1>What will the suggestion age look like?</h1>
          <p>Let's begin with a snapshot of a relaxed Saturday morning in the Age of Suggestion.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10pt;">You feel like going out and doing something, so you pick up your phone, unlocking it with facial recognition. Two buttons appear on the screen: an image of a car and an image of some people talking. You press the image of the car. 5 minutes later, the nearest available car pulls up outside your house and your phone gives you a notification. You walk outside, sit down in the car, and a message appears on the dashboard. "Would you like to message <i>Dave Shepherd</i> saying "Hi Dave, let's meet up for a coffee?". You shake your head. Another message appears saying, "No worries! How about you message <i>Sarah Day</i> saying "Hi Sarah, long time no see! Would you like to grab a bite to eat?". You nod your head, and the car begins driving to a local cafe.</p>
          <p>The age of suggestion is built from the intersection of three concurrent technological advances</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Self-driving cars</li>
            <li>Suggestion algorithms (eg spotify, youtube, etc)</li>
            <li>AI</li>
          </ol>
          In the scenario above, predictive AI combines the 'media content' suggestions we're used to from streaming services into activity suggestions gleaned from the past behaviour of users as well as the content of their messages and possibly phone calls. The behaviour suggestions take the form of binary 'yes/no' options that inform future suggestions. The AI will consider things like who has the person not seen for a while, and possibly physiological factors like if the user is calm, who do they tend to want to see, compared with if they are restless, bored, horny, tired, etc.

          <h1>How do you know we're entering the suggestion age?</h1>
          <p>I described the above scenario to a friend and they said "That sounds convenient". That alone is almost enough to guarantee its arrival, since people will always choose convenience over fulfillment.</p>
          <p>More generally, the age of suggestion follows from some key observations</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The general evolution of content consumption from choosing from a large library (think a video rental store, bookshop, etc), through to a limited set of recommendations (netflix, social media 'feeds'), through to binary yes-no choices (Tiktok and imitators). The yes-no model is seen in dating apps as well.</li>
            <li>The presence of AI in messaging apps, which as of 2025 now offers to rephrase your messages, summarise others' messages, and so on</li>
            <li>The clear commercial benefits from influencing consumer behaviours, eg to go to a certain shop</li>
            <li>The development of driverless car (and hence taxi) technology being mostly complete</li>
            <li>The improvement in quality of AI-suggested replies to emails and so on</li>
            <li>The growing tendency of people to find decisions and social interactions 'overwhelming'</li>
          </ul>
        <h1>So What?</h1>
        <p>If this future seems bright to you, then it's possible that we have nothing to say to each other. Otherwise, some consequences are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The blandification of life: The AI will always suggest the cafe or the pub, perhaps going for a walk or a swim, the gym or the pool. It will never suggest breaking into the abandoned Buddhist Monastery and filming smashing plates into cisterns in slow motion</li>
          <li>The loss of the sense of agency, purpose, and control over our lives</li>
          <li>The positive feedback loop: The more people use services like this, the harder it will be to exist outside the services. Today, people lament how dating apps are so bad, yet because everyone else is using them, meeting romantic partners using other methods becomes automatically harder. </li>
